# Expense-Tracker-Collaboration
Reflection:
1) Trevor Au:
   Add and view expenses
2) Mac Verayangkura:
   Calculate total expense
3) Yifan Ren:
   Delete expenses

Challenges: 
Trevor Au: 
All of the syntax errors when trying to get the code to work under various situations.
Fixing this was rather simple, I just ask my teammates for help, oftentimes they came up with quick and efficient solutions.

Mac:
Planning has been a problem here since we didn't communicate enough; some of us were still coding with the old version, and we had to move things back and forth between versions a couple of times.

Yifan:
I think the challenge is ensuring that my code runs compatibly with my teammates' code. I need to continuously fix my code based on error messages.

Did we like collaborative coding?

We liked collaborative coding overall, but our communication and conflicts really hindered our ability to work efficiently.
